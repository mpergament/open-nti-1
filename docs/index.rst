=====================

.. _here: http://forums.juniper.net/t5/Analytics/Open-Source-Universal-Telemetry-Collector-for-Junos/ba-p/288677

OpenNTI is a container packaged with all tools needed to collect and visualize time series data from network devices.
Data can be collected from different sources:
 - **Data Collection Agent** : Collect data on devices using CLI/Shell or Netconf
 - **Data Streaming Collector** : Take all data streamed by Juniper devices as Input (JTI, Analyticsd, soon Openconfig with gRPC)
 - **Statsd interface** : Accept any Statsd packets

It's pre-configured with all tools and with a default dashboard ..
**Send it data, it will graph it**

Thanks to docker, it can run pretty much anywhere on server, on laptop ... on the device itself

More detailed description of a project can be found here_ (including a series of videos on how to use it):
